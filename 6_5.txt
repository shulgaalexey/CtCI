6.5 There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it will break.
If it/s dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You are given two eggs.
Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.


Assume that we are dropping the first egg from fl M
If the egg isn't break, we are going M fls upper.
Else we are going M fl lower and continuously dropping the second egg on each fl
Finally we can find the N'th fl where the second egg is break.


Formula for the worst case (N = 99)

Drops = N / M + (M - 1)


The min of function y = 100 / x + x -1 is y(10) = 19
So the amount of drops in the worst case is 19.
