6.1 You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 gram.
Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle?
You can only use the scale once.

Solution

a) Draw a number on each bottle (from 1 to 20)
b)
  1. Take one pill from bottle1 and put it on the scale
  2. Take two pills from bottle2 and put it on the scale
  3. Take three pills from bottle3 and put it on the scale
  ....
  20. Take twenty pills from bottle20 and put it on the scale
c) Check the total mass m.
   In fact it is a sum 1*m1 + 2*m2 + 3*m3 + ... + 20*m20 where mi is a mass of pill from bottle i
d) Suppose that each pill has mass 1.0 (without exceptions, such as 1.1 gram pills).
   The summary mass would be
      ((1 + 20) / 2) * 20 = 210
e) Calculate the difference of real and supposed masses
      dm = m - 210,   dm = [0.1 ... 2.0]
f) The difference dm is caused by extra mass of pills from the bottle N:
      dm = 0.1 gram * N
g) Consolidating (e) and (f):
 m - 210 = 0.1 * N
   or
      N = 10 * (m- 210)
h) Finish
