6.6 There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. A msn begins by opening all 100 lockers.
Next he closes every second locker. Then, on his third pass, he toggles every third locker
(closes if it is open or opens if it is closed). This process continues for 100 passes,
such that on each pass i the man toggles every ith locker. After his 100 pass in the hallway,
in which he toggles only locker #100, how many lockers are open?

Solution: 10

* Al lockers which numbers can be devided on an odd amount of dividers will be open.

* Such numbers are squares of x, x = [1...10], because  each square has dividers: 1, x, x^2
There may be deviders between 1 and x, but the same amount of dividers will be between x and x^2

* Non-square number can not have such properties
