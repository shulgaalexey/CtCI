6.4 A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order:
all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. There will be a flight
out at 8:00 pm every evening. Each person can see eeryone else's eye color, but they do no know
their own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally, they do not know how many
people have blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does. How many days
will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?


Solution for ~ (log(blue_eyed_amount) + 2) days
------------------------------------------------
1. Every day people randomly stand in two rows of same length
2. If someone from the first row sees a blue-eyed in the opposite row, he is going home,
and the blue-eyed understands everithyng ang goes to the airport
3. Repeat untli noone will go home
4. Finish in about (log(blu_eyed_amount) + 2) days


Solution for one day
--------------------
1. People randomly stand in two rows of same length
2. If someone sees a blue-eyed in the opposite row, he goes home
  a. The blue-eyed understands everithing and goes to the airport
  b. If both go home, they understand everithing ang go to the airport together
3. Finish: all blu-eyed went to the airport
