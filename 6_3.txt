6.3 You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups).
How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oodly formed, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

1. Fill 3q-jug with water
2. Pour water from 3q-jug to 5q-jug
3. Fill 3q-jug with water
4. Pour water from 3q-jug to 5q-jug; only 2q will fit, so 1 q will remain in 3q-jug
5. Empty 5q-jug
6. Pour 1q of water from 3q-jug to 5q-jug
7. Fill 3q-jug with water
8. Pour water from 3q-jug to 5q-jug
9. Finish
