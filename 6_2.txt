6.2 There  is an 8x8 chess board in which two diagonally opposite corners have
been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares.
Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer
(by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

0) Pre-check: 31 dominos is enough to cover the given board


The given chess board
----------------------
Some dominos are randomly placed for example

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

1  # - - - - - - -
2  - - - < > - - -
3  - - - - - - - -
.  - ^ - - - - - -
.  - V - - - - - -
8  - - - - - - - #


  # - cut off corner
  <, ^ - one side of domino
  > V - another side of domino
  - - empty square

  < > - the whole domino horizontally

  ^
  V - the whole domino vertically


Approach 1.
----------------

1. Board NxN can be reduced to (N-2)xN by covering an edge starting from one cut off corner with two rows
of dominos

   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

1  # < > < > < > ^
2  ^ < > < > < > V
3  V - - - - - - -
.  - - - - - - - -
.  - - - - - - - -
8  - - - - - - - #

2. Consequently, board NxN can be reduced to
 - 2xN if N is even
 - 1XN if N is odd (but this case is not interested,
because the entire NxN board square will also be odd which can only be filled
with fractional number of dominos, which is differ from the task statement)

3. Assume that reduced board size is 2xN.
It can be perfectly filled with dominos only if N is odd, because cut off corners reducing the length
of each row to (N-1) and (N-1) must be even.

Good example, can cover the board 5x2
 # < > < >
 < > < > #
Bad example, can not cover the board 6x2
 # < > < > -  - < > < > #

Assumption that N is odd is not matching section (2),
  so the given board 8x8 can not be covered with dominos entirely.

4*. In addition to aforementioned we can see that only boards Nx(N+1) can
be covered entirely with proper amount of dominos

Approach 2.
--------------
1. The minimal board with two opposinte corners cut off has size 2x3 or 3x2 (doesn't matter)

  # ^
  ^ V
  V #

  or

 # < >
 < > #

2. If the given board NxN can be reduced to
 - 2x3 - it is coverable
 - 2x2 it is not coverable

3. Covering 8x8 board by alg A is reducing it to 2x2 board, so it is not coverable

4*. Note that 8x9 board can be covered

Algorithm A
~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Covering outer border of NxN board;
getting uncovered board (N-2)x(N-2)
2. Repeating until border size is 2x3 or 2x2
3. Finish

Example:
Step 1.
Reducing board 8x8

   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

1  # < > < > < > ^
2  < > - - - - - V
3  ^ - - - - - - ^
4  V - - - - - - V
5  ^ - - - - - - ^
6  V - - - - - - V
7  ^ - - - - - < >
8  V < > < > < > #

Obtainint reduced board 6x6

   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

1  # # # # # # # #
2  # # - - - - - #
3  # - - - - - - #
4  # - - - - - - #
5  # - - - - - - #
6  # - - - - - - #
7  # - - - - - # #
8  # # # # # # # #


Books Solution
---------------
If two corners are cut off then the amount of black squares is different with amount of white ones.
But if we have 31 dominos we can only cover similar amount of black and white squares.
Therefore it is impossible to cover the board with 31 dominos.
