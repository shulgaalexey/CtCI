 7.1 You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
 Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop.
 Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
 If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which value of p should
 you pick one game or the other?

 Solution

 1. Let probability of winning the game is p*

 Game 1: 1 shot,  1 hoop
 p1* = p



 Game 2: 3 shots, 2 of 3 hoops

 Lets hoops names are A, B and C

 p2* = p(hit A, B, C)
	+ p(hit A, B and miss C)
	+ p(hit A, C and miss  B)
	+ p(hit B, C and miss  A)

p(hit hoop) = p
p(miss hoop) = 1 - p

so

p2* = p * p * p + 3 * p * p * (1 - p)
p2* = p^3 + 3p^2 * (1 - p)
p2* = 3p^2 - 2p^3


 2. Choosing a game:

 Choose Game 1 if p1* > p2*
 p > 3p^2 - 2p^3
 p < 0.5


 Choose Game 2 if p1* < p2*
 p < 3p^2 - 2p^3
 p > 0.5

 Choose Game 1 or Game 2 if p1* = p2*
 p = p(p - 1)(p - 2)
 p1 = 0
 or
 p2 = 0.5
 or
 p3 = 1
